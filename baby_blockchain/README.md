**Overview and purpose:** The purpose of this project is to create a blockchain-based digital identity system that empowers individuals with control over their personal information and ensures the privacy of their data. The system will be based on self-sovereignty, privacy, verifiable claims, and security, ensuring that users are the only ones who can manage their digital identity.

**System content:** The system will consist of a blockchain platform that will keep a list of issuers and the state of the issuer. The blockchain will be maintained by a network of nodes and will be secure and decentralized, providing users with full control over their personal information.

**Interaction:** The system may interact with other systems and components, such as government agencies, financial institutions, and other organizations, for the purpose of identity verification and data exchange. The system will also provide APIs for integration with existing systems and components, allowing for seamless data exchange while ensuring privacy and security.

**Product features:** The system will provide users with a secure and user-friendly interface for managing their digital identity. It will allow for the creation and storage of digital identities and the secure exchange of data between parties. The system will offer privacy options, ensuring that users can maintain control over their personal information. Additionally, the platform will use zero-knowledge proofs to verify claims without revealing the full document, making it possible to maintain privacy while still proving identity.

**Security requirements:** The system will be designed with security as a top priority. It will comply with industry standards for blockchain security and will include encryption, secure key management, and other security measures to ensure the protection of user data. With the platform, no one can get access to user's files and every single document once on the ledger stays on the ledger, making it virtually unhackable.

**Characteristics of users:** The end users of the system will be individuals who are seeking to securely store and manage their personal information. The system will be accessible to anyone with an internet connection and will provide a simple and user-friendly interface for managing their digital identity.

**Restrictions:** The system may be subject to certain restrictions, such as compliance with government regulations, data privacy laws, and other relevant legal requirements.
